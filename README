This a read me file for my OS project 2. I am creating this file to test to make sure remote origin working correctly.

I would suggest running make clean first to clean up any mess left behind. Then I would run make. 
To invoke the program rub master.

For more info run master -h for usage.

I was able to make a program that solved the problem at hand.
I did allocate shared memory but couldn't get to work properly so instead I just passed the palidrome to the child as an argument.
I will make sure to correct this later.
Command line parsing is correct.
Critical section problem was not solved
No timeout.
